      <h3 class="travel-heading">&#9992; Flying to Italy</h3>
      <p class="travel-text">Most guests will fly internationally into <strong>Rome Fiumicino (FCO)</strong> — it's the largest and best-connected airport, about 2.5–3 hours from Petritoli by car. We recommend booking flights into Rome.</p>
      <p class="travel-text">If you're already traveling in Europe or plan to visit other parts of Italy first, you can also fly into a regional airport closer to Petritoli:</p>

      <h3 class="travel-heading">&#128663; Getting to Petritoli</h3>
      <p class="travel-text">Once you've landed or arrived by train, you have two options to reach us:</p>
      <p class="travel-text"><strong>Rent a car</strong> — we'd recommend this if you're interested in exploring the region on your own before or after the wedding. From Rome, take the A24 motorway east across the Apennine Mountains, then connect to the A14 along the Adriatic coast — it's a beautiful, scenic drive through rolling hills and mountain passes. Petritoli is a small hilltop village with no taxis, so having a car gives you the freedom to venture out to nearby towns, vineyards, and the coast on your own schedule. You'll need an International Driving Permit (see checklist below).</p>
      <p class="travel-text"><strong>Car service</strong> — we can arrange private car service to pick you up from any airport or train station, at any time. Our wedding planner will coordinate this. Just share your arrival details in the <a href="#" onclick="showPage('rsvp');return false;" class="inline-link">RSVP</a> and we'll take care of the rest. Cost varies depending on distance and number of passengers — for a round trip to and from Rome, expect around €80–150 per person. We'll group guests with similar arrival times to help lower the cost.</p>

    <div class="travel-section">
      <h3 class="travel-heading">&#127969; Once You're in Petritoli</h3>
      <p class="travel-text">You won't need a car during the celebration itself. All events are either in town or at the Palazzo, and we'll organize transportation for anything off-site (like the beach day). Everything in the village is walkable — sit back, relax, and let us handle the logistics.</p>
      <p class="travel-text">That said, there are no taxis in Petritoli — so if you think you'll want to explore the surrounding area independently during the week, a rental car is the way to go. If you don't have a car but need to get around while you're here, you can work with our wedding planner once you arrive to arrange separate car service.</p>
