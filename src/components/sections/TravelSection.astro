      <h3 class="travel-heading">&#9992; Flying to Italy</h3>
      <p class="travel-text"><strong>Rome Fiumicino (FCO)</strong> is the recommended airport for most guests - it has the most international flights and direct connections from the U.S. and Canada. From there, it's about 3–3.5 hours to Petritoli by car.</p>
      <p class="travel-text">If you're already traveling in Europe, you can also fly into one of these regional airports closer to Petritoli:</p>

      <h3 class="travel-heading">&#128663; Getting to Petritoli</h3>
      <p class="travel-text">Once you've arrived in Italy, you have two options to reach Petritoli:</p>

      <h4 style="color:var(--deep-blue); font-size:1rem; margin:24px 0 10px; font-weight:500;">Option 1: Rent a Car (Highly Recommended!)</h4>
      <p class="travel-text">If there's one piece of advice we'd give, it's this: <strong>rent a car</strong>. It gives you total freedom to explore one of Italy's most beautiful regions at your own pace - stop at a vineyard, detour to a hilltop village, drive to the coast for lunch. Petritoli is a small village with no taxis, so a car means you're never stuck waiting for anyone else's schedule.</p>
      <p class="travel-text">From Rome, take the A24 motorway east across the Apennine Mountains, then connect to the A14 along the Adriatic coast - it's a gorgeous, scenic drive through rolling hills and mountain passes. Many guests have told us this drive was one of the highlights of their trip. You'll need an International Driving Permit (see checklist below), and we recommend booking your rental early as prices go up in peak season.</p>

      <h4 style="color:var(--deep-blue); font-size:1rem; margin:24px 0 10px; font-weight:500;">Option 2: Car or Bus Transfer Service</h4>
      <p class="travel-text">We'll help arrange car or bus transfers to bring you to Petritoli! We expect most guests will already be in Rome by August 31st, so we're arranging <strong>one main shuttle departing at approximately 2:00 PM from Rome Tiburtina Station</strong> on August 31st. Tiburtina is easy to reach from anywhere in the city and helps us avoid heavy city-center traffic. From Rome Tiburtina to Petritoli, the drive is approximately 2.5–3 hours depending on traffic.</p>
      <p class="travel-text">If you'd like a transfer from a different location (such as the airport), please indicate your arrival time in your <a href="#" onclick="showPage('rsvp');return false;" class="inline-link">RSVP</a> and we'll group guests together to the best of our ability.</p>
      <p class="travel-text" style="background:rgba(107,141,181,0.08); border-left:3px solid var(--sky-blue); padding:14px 18px; border-radius:0 8px 8px 0; margin:16px 0;">Just a heads up, transfers are an additional cost that will depend on the number of guests sharing the ride. We're doing our best to group people together to keep the price as low as possible for everyone - your flexibility on timing really helps with this!</p>

      <h4 style="color:var(--deep-blue); font-size:1rem; margin:24px 0 10px; font-weight:500;">Leaving Petritoli</h4>
      <p class="travel-text">We'll also arrange a <strong>main shuttle departing at approximately 11:00 AM on September 4th</strong> heading back to Rome after checkout. If you'd like a shuttle at a different time or to a different destination, let us know in your <a href="#" onclick="showPage('rsvp');return false;" class="inline-link">RSVP</a> and we'll do our best to help arrange it - costs will depend on the route and group size.</p>

    <div class="travel-section">
      <h3 class="travel-heading">&#127969; Once You're in Petritoli</h3>
      <p class="travel-text">You won't need a car during the celebration itself. All events are either in town or at the Palazzo, and we'll organize transportation for anything off-site (like the beach day). Everything in the village is walkable - sit back, relax, and let us handle the logistics.</p>
      <p class="travel-text">Also, there are no taxis in Petritoli - so if you think you'll want to explore the surrounding area independently during the week, a rental car is the way to go. If you don't have a car but need to get around while you're here, you can work with our wedding planner once you arrive to arrange separate car service.</p>
