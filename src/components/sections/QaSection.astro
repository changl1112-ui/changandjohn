        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Each event has its own vibe. The wedding ceremony and reception is <strong>formal / black-tie optional</strong> — think elegant evening wear. The welcome pizza party and post-wedding brunch are <strong>smart casual</strong>. The beach day and farewell dinner are <strong>casual / resort wear</strong>. Check the <a class="inline-link" href="#schedule" onclick="showPage('schedule'); return false;">Schedule</a> page for dress codes by event.

          <p>No — our ceremony will be a non-religious, symbolic ceremony held in the Panoramic Garden at Palazzo Mannocchi. It will be personal, heartfelt, and officiated by someone very special to us.</p>

          <p>Yes! Children are welcome at the wedding and all events. The palazzo has plenty of space for kids to run around, including gardens and pool areas. If your child has specific dietary needs, please note them on your RSVP. Children under 12 stay at the palazzo free of charge.</p>

          <span class="faq-toggle">+</span>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p><strong>Rome Fiumicino (FCO)</strong> is our top recommendation — it has the most international flight options and is about 3.5 hours from Petritoli by car. Ancona (AOI) is closer (~1 hr) but has limited flights. Check the <a class="inline-link" href="#travel" onclick="showPage('travel'); return false;">Travel</a> page for all airport options and details.</p>

          <span class="faq-toggle">+</span>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>U.S. and Canadian passport holders do not need a visa for stays under 90 days. Make sure your passport is valid for at least 6 months beyond your travel dates. If you hold a different passport, check Schengen visa requirements for your nationality. We're happy to provide an invitation letter if needed — just ask.</p>

          <span class="faq-toggle">+</span>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>A rental car is great for getting from the airport to Petritoli and gives you flexibility to explore before or after the wedding week. However, <strong>you won't need a car during the week itself</strong> — everything is walkable in the village, and we'll arrange transportation for off-site events like the beach day and tours. If you do rent, note that you may need an International Driving Permit (IDP).</p>

          <span class="faq-toggle">+</span>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Yes! We can help arrange shared shuttles or private car services from the airports. Just indicate on your RSVP that you'd like shuttle coordination and share your arrival details — we'll group guests by timing and sort it out. A private car service from Rome FCO is approximately €280–350 one way for up to 4 passengers.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Absolutely — we encourage it! Rome, Florence, Tuscany, the Amalfi Coast, Cinque Terre, Lake Como, and Venice are all reachable. A popular strategy is to fly into one city and out of another.

          <p>Staying at Palazzo Mannocchi is <strong>€280 per person</strong> (ages 12+) for the entire week — August 31st through September 4th. Children under 12 stay free. This covers accommodation only; meals during scheduled events are separately arranged and covered.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>It's an 18th-century noble residence — charming and historic, but <strong>not a hotel</strong>. Think cozy slumber party in an Italian castle. Bathrooms are shared, the hallways creak, the plumbing has personality, and the furniture is antique. It has 40 bedrooms, 2 pools, a jacuzzi, WiFi, and the village is right outside the door. It's communal living at its best — and honestly, it's where the magic happens.

          <p>Towels and bed linens are provided. However, there are <strong>no hotel-style toiletries</strong> — bring your own shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and any products you need.

        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Totally fine! There are small hotels and Airbnbs in Petritoli and nearby towns where you can have complete privacy and your own bathroom. You can also find your own accommodation further afield. Just let us know on your RSVP so we can plan accordingly. You're still invited to all events either way!</p>

        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Yes — there's WiFi throughout the palazzo, including the bedrooms. That said, it's a centuries-old building in a small Italian village, so manage expectations accordingly. It works fine for messaging and social media, but maybe don't plan to stream movies all week. (You won't want to anyway.)</p>

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>We'd love for everyone to arrive by Monday, August 31st — that's when check-in begins and gives you time to settle in before the week kicks off. If you can only make it for the wedding day, that works too! Just let us know your arrival date on the RSVP so we can plan accordingly.</p>

          <p>Yes! Please note any dietary restrictions or allergies on your RSVP — we'll make sure our caterers are informed. Italian cuisine is naturally accommodating for vegetarian and gluten-free diets, but we want to make sure everyone is taken care of.</p>

          <p>Tuesday (September 1st) is the main exploration day with the group activity.

        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Early September in Le Marche is beautiful — warm and sunny with temperatures around 25–28°C (77–82°F) during the day, cooling to about 18–20°C (64–68°F) in the evening. Rain is unlikely but possible. Pack a light layer for evenings — it can feel cooler than expected after sunset, especially in the hilltop breeze.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Italy uses the Euro (€). Small villages like Petritoli are still quite cash-oriented — not all shops and restaurants accept credit cards, especially smaller ones. We recommend bringing some euros with you and withdrawing more from one of the 2 ATMs in town. Your bank card should work, but notify your bank you'll be traveling.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Yes! Italy uses <strong>Type L and Type C plugs</strong> (220V, round prongs). If you're coming from the US, UK, or other countries with different plug types, you'll need a travel adapter. We strongly recommend bringing a universal adapter or an Italy-specific one.

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Petritoli is a real Italian village — not a tourist town. Most locals speak little to no English, which is part of the charm!

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>It depends on your phone plan. Many US carriers offer international day passes (T-Mobile, AT&T, Verizon) that work well for a week. If your plan doesn't include European roaming, picking up a prepaid Italian SIM card at the airport is easy and affordable.

          <p>Yes — Petritoli has a pharmacy within walking distance. There's also a 24-hour emergency medical service just 5 minutes away by car.
