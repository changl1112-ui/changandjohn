        <p class="explore-text">Petritoli is a small, walkable village in the Le Marche countryside with about 2,500 residents. It's not a tourist town - it's a real place where locals know each other by name, shops close for siesta, and the piazza comes alive in the evenings. Everything you need is within a few minutes on foot from the Palazzo.</p>

          <p class="explore-text">This one gets its own section. Tre Archi is <em>the</em> gathering spot in Petritoli - right inside the famous three arches. This is where all the locals go for breakfast every morning, so if you want to experience real Italian daily life, start your day here with an espresso and a cornetto. It opens at 6:30 AM and stays open until the last person leaves. Their artisan gelato (made with rice milk) is legendary - multiple reviewers call it the best gelato in Italy. They also serve local wines, craft beer, aperitivi, pastries, and light meals. Gluten-free options including cones are available. You'll end up here every day - trust us. And who knows… you might even get a taste of their gelato at the wedding itself. 🤫</p>

          <h4 class="explore-subheading">What to Eat in Le Marche</h4>
          <p class="explore-text">Le Marche has a rich food culture that rivals any region in Italy. Keep an eye out for: <em>olive all'ascolana</em> (stuffed fried olives - the local specialty), <em>vincisgrassi</em> (a rich lasagna with pork, mushrooms, and sometimes truffles), <em>ciauscolo</em> (a soft, spreadable salami unique to this region), local <em>pecorino</em> cheese (try it fresh or aged), <em>brodetto</em> (Adriatic fish stew with saffron), and <em>porchetta</em> (suckling pig with fennel and garlic). The region is also known for its truffles, honey, and <em>vino cotto</em> ("cooked wine" - a traditional dessert wine).</p>

          <h4 class="explore-subheading">Good to Know</h4>
          <p class="explore-text">Petritoli has a pharmacy, bank, 2 ATMs, and a post office - all within walking distance. There's also a 24-hour emergency medical service just 5 minutes away. Italy is still quite cash-oriented, especially in small villages - bring euros and don't rely entirely on credit cards. Our wedding planner and her team will be on the ground to help with additional recommendations and questions - we'll share her number the week of the wedding.</p>
