    <p class="explore-intro">We'd love for you to make this trip more than just a wedding — it's a chance to experience one of Italy's most beautiful and unspoiled regions. Here's everything you need to know about what's around you.</p>

        <h3 class="zone-title">Petritoli</h3>
        <p class="zone-subtitle">Your home base — a medieval hilltop village</p>
      </div>

      <p class="explore-text">Petritoli is a small, walkable village in the Le Marche countryside with about 2,500 residents. It's not a tourist town — it's a real place where locals know each other by name, shops close for siesta, and the piazza comes alive in the evenings. Everything you need is within a few minutes on foot from the Palazzo.</p>

        <h4 class="explore-subheading">Must-Try: Bar Gelateria Tre Archi</h4>
        <p class="explore-text">This one gets its own section. Tre Archi is <em>the</em> gathering spot in Petritoli — right inside the famous three arches. This is where all the locals go for breakfast every morning, so if you want to experience real Italian daily life, start your day here with an espresso and a cornetto. It opens at 6:30 AM and stays open until the last person leaves. Their artisan gelato (made with rice milk) is legendary — multiple reviewers call it the best gelato in Italy. They also serve local wines, craft beer, aperitivi, pastries, and light meals. Gluten-free options including cones are available. You'll end up here every day — trust us. And who knows… you might even get a taste of their gelato at the wedding itself. 🤫</p>

      <div class="explore-subsection">
        <h4 class="explore-subheading">What to Eat in Le Marche</h4>
        <p class="explore-text">Le Marche has a rich food culture that rivals any region in Italy. Keep an eye out for: <em>olive all'ascolana</em> (stuffed fried olives — the local specialty), <em>vincisgrassi</em> (a rich lasagna with pork, mushrooms, and sometimes truffles), <em>ciauscolo</em> (a soft, spreadable salami unique to this region), local <em>pecorino</em> cheese (try it fresh or aged), <em>brodetto</em> (Adriatic fish stew with saffron), and <em>porchetta</em> (suckling pig with fennel and garlic). The region is also known for its truffles, honey, and <em>vino cotto</em> ("cooked wine" — a traditional dessert wine).</p>

      <div class="explore-subsection">
        <h4 class="explore-subheading">Good to Know</h4>
        <p class="explore-text">Petritoli has a pharmacy, bank, 2 ATMs, and a post office — all within walking distance. There's also a 24-hour emergency medical service just 5 minutes away. Italy is still quite cash-oriented, especially in small villages — bring euros and don't rely entirely on credit cards. Our wedding planner and her team will be on the ground to help with additional recommendations and questions — we'll share her number the week of the wedding.</p>

        <p class="zone-subtitle">Italy's best-kept secret — rolling hills, coastline, and mountains</p>
      </div>

      <p class="explore-text">Le Marche is one of Italy's most underrated regions — the Italians themselves call it the most beautiful region in the country. Think Tuscany's beauty without the crowds. Our wedding planner works with local guides to organize group tours, and we highly recommend joining at least one. It's a fantastic way to connect with the area and with each other.</p>

      <!-- TUESDAY TOURS -->
      <div class="explore-subsection">
        <h4 class="explore-subheading">Tuesday Group Activity</h4>
        <p class="explore-text" style="margin-bottom:20px;">Tuesday, September 1st is our group activity day. We're organizing <strong>grape stomping</strong> as the main group experience — it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that's only available in September, and it's best with a big group. If grape stomping isn't your thing, we're offering a few smaller alternative tours you can join instead. You'll select your preference on your <a href="#" onclick="showPage('rsvp');return false;" class="inline-link">RSVP</a>.</p>
        <p class="explore-text explore-text--note" style="margin-bottom:24px;">Tours that require car or bus transportation will cost an additional ~€10–20 per person for the shuttle. We recommend not scheduling anything for the morning after the wedding, as you may be tired (or perhaps still celebrating!).</p>

You'll stomp grapes, enjoy a traditional lunch prepared with ancient local recipes, and be entertained by folk music with traditional players and dancers. This is a full-day celebration of the harvest season and it's the kind of thing you'll never forget.</p>
