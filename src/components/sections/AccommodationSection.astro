    <p class="accom-text" style="text-align:center; margin-bottom:40px; font-size:1.05rem;">We've booked the entire Palazzo Mannocchi from August 31st through September 4th, and we'd love for everyone to stay with us. The whole property is ours — no other guests, no strangers, just our people.</p>

      <h3 class="accom-heading">A Medieval Palazzo with Centuries of History</h3>
      <p class="accom-text">Petritoli is a small medieval hilltop village in the Le Marche region — one of Italy's best-kept secrets. It's not a tourist town. It's a real, lived-in place where locals greet you in the piazza and the baker still opens at dawn.</p>
      <p class="accom-text">At its heart sits Palazzo Mannocchi, an 18th-century noble residence built atop foundations that date back to the Roman period. The property takes up nearly a quarter of the village center. Over the centuries it served as a seat of local nobility, a gathering place for the community, and now — for one unforgettable week — it's ours.</p>
      <p class="accom-text">Inside you'll find frescoed ceilings, vaulted halls, period furniture, and panoramic views stretching from the Adriatic Sea to the Sibillini Mountains. It has 40 bedrooms, 19 bathrooms, 9 kitchens, grand salons, terraces, balconies, a rose garden, two swimming pools, and a large jacuzzi. There's WiFi throughout, including the bedrooms.</p>

      <h3 class="accom-heading">What to Expect — Please Read</h3>
      <p class="accom-text">We want to be completely upfront: <strong>the Palazzo is not a hotel</strong>. It is a centuries-old historic property with all the charm — and all the quirks — that come with that.</p>
      <p class="accom-text">Think of it as a cozy, slightly wild slumber party in a medieval Italian castle. The furniture is antique (read: character, not luxury). Bathrooms are shared. Some hallways creak. The plumbing has its own personality. There is no front desk, no room service, no concierge. We'll be looking after ourselves and each other — and that's part of what makes it special.</p>
      <p class="accom-text">The palazzo is divided so that different groups — couples, families, friends — can have their own private bedrooms, suites, or even entire floors, while sharing the communal spaces like salons, pool terraces, and balconies. You'll have your own space to retreat to, but the best part is being together under one very old, very beautiful roof.</p>
      <p class="accom-text">If you're coming with the right expectations, it's magic. If you're expecting a five-star resort — this isn't it, and we want you to know that upfront so you can plan accordingly.</p>

        <div class="accom-option">
          <div class="accom-option-title">Stay at the Palazzo</div>
          <div class="accom-option-desc">Join the group for the full experience — communal living, poolside hangs, and late-night conversations in the salons. This is the heart of the celebration and where the magic happens.</div>

          <div class="accom-option-title">Stay in town</div>

          <div class="accom-option-desc">If you prefer to find your own Airbnb or hotel nearby, you're welcome to. Just keep in mind that Petritoli is a small village — options are limited, so book early.</div>
