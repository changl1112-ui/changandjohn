    <p class="accom-text" style="text-align:center; margin-bottom:32px; font-size:1.05rem;">We've booked the entire Palazzo Mannocchi from August 31st through September 4th, and we'd love for everyone to stay with us. The whole property is ours — no other guests, no strangers, just our people.</p>

      <h3 class="accom-heading">&#127984; About the Palazzo</h3>
      <p class="accom-text">Palazzo Mannocchi is an 18th-century castle property in the heart of Petritoli village. It has frescoed ceilings, vaulted halls from the Roman period, period furniture, and panoramic views of the sea and mountains. The place takes up nearly a quarter of the village center — it's massive and beautiful and a little wild.</p>
      <p class="accom-text">It has 40 bedrooms, 19 bathrooms, 9 kitchens, grand salons, terraces, balconies, a rose garden, two swimming pools, and a large jacuzzi. There's WiFi throughout, including the bedrooms. And with the village right outside the door, you won't need a car for anything during the week.</p>

      <h3 class="accom-heading">&#128719; What to Expect</h3>
      <p class="accom-text">We want to be upfront: <strong>this is not a hotel</strong>. It's a charming, centuries-old property — think cozy slumber party in an Italian castle, not a resort. Bathrooms and common areas are shared, we'll be looking after ourselves, and the furniture is antique (read: character, not concierge).</p>
      <p class="accom-text">The palazzo is divided so that different groups — couples, families, friends — can have their own private bedrooms, suites, or even entire floors, while sharing the communal spaces like salons, pool terraces, and balconies. You'll have your own space to retreat to, but the best part is being together.</p>

    <div class="accom-section">
      <h3 class="accom-heading">&#127976; Prefer Your Own Space?</h3>
      <p class="accom-text">Totally get it — the communal vibe isn't for everyone. There are nearby Airbnbs and hotels in and around Petritoli that we can help you organize. Just let us know on your <a href="#" onclick="showPage('rsvp');return false;" style="color:var(--fresh-orange);text-decoration:underline;">RSVP</a> and we'll help sort it out.</p>
